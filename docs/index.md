# Abstract
Many sites in need of surveillance are often affected by low-resolution camera quality and low bandwidth data transfer rates. However, software when utilized effectively can alleviate the shortcomings of hardware. The field of image processing is filled with exceptional and very powerful methods of enhancing image quality. Such methods are mainly powered by the revolutionary concept of deep learning algorithms. Very low bandwidth data transfer is also possible using the concept of compressive sensing, which allows nearly full reconstruction of an image from only a fraction of total pixels. combining both these concepts of superresolution and compressive sensing can provide exceptional results. In this project, we aim to create a neural network model that would be capable of both reconstruction of an image from a fraction of the original pixel size and enhancing it and generating an output image of higher resolution than the original. Finally, we compare the original image with our results and calculate a similarity metric, and measure the effectiveness of our algorithm. If effective, such a model will have many uses throughout the different industries for data reconstruction and enhancement.
